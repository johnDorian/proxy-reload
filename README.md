# Reload map

This is an experimental (aka no support) repo for a reverse proxy which is designed to run infront of [valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo) with an additional end point to force reload the map file on the robot. Whilst reload the map, the proxy is blocked stopping valetudo users from interacting with the valetudo app during the reloading process.
